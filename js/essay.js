			"text" : ["Globally, each day billions of people rely upon the services of the internet and its supporting infrastructures for services ranging from communication to commerce. Alongside website content, ephemeral products such as “cloud” storage systems allow us to store and backup our digital lives whilst remain invisible to users. Yet, is our digital existence really immaterial, as intangible as these names suggest?", 
			"In fact, this vast digital network manifests in a very physical format. A quick online search of “data centres'' provides us with a mirage of technologically marvellous imagery, monstrous buildings in desolate landscapes, consolidated, isolated, optimised. In these buildings exist endless TikTok stories, dusted snapshots of forgotten pasts, and the latest tweets of our political stars.", 
			"The performance of high-tech architecture has already started. Sometimes it puts on visible costume: the mechanical nature, vast scale and cold colour palette of these volumes communicate an architecture that proudly expresses its artificial nature. Huge banks of axial fans, uninsulated finishes and the residual phantom lighting emitted from each server box provide such spaces with an unrecognisable, eerie quality. The set of a sci-fi movie is not a fiction anymore. The theatricality comes to riveting climax through an ultra-HD reality of monumental grey boxes, electrifying coloured interior lighting and a crescendo of humming fans.", "Such architectural amalgamations exist to serve human needs, but remain free from the requirements of bodily occupation. These are spaces of automated activity that need not meet the human requirements of access, lighting and ventilation, rather possessing a post-human pragmatism to suit technological demand. Facebook's Lulea server farm in northern Sweden exemplifies the dismissal of human necessity, instead residing in a locale defined by cool climate and privacy through isolation. In such contexts, a data centre finds comfort, security and can exist almost in entire autonomy.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='1'></span>", "Located in desolate landscapes, scattered along borderlines and increasingly located in the sea, the innate transience of data allows its architectural manifestations to conquer territory which people simply cannot. This inhuman advantage often caters to the fundamental needs of our data: space, climate and security. Perhaps the only remaining humanism of such vernacular spaces is that of aestheticism, visual characteristics that can be distilled into digital imagery and humorously relayed to the audience; an actuality manifested in Switch's Las Vegas data centre, freed from the need to provide easing white lighting, this building instead utilises conspicuous red and blue coloured lights to spectacular effect, though purely for marketing purposes.", "Although seeming distant, many of these infrastructures are actually moving closer to us. Thanks to edge computing, a distributional strategy of the internet of things, data processing is increasingly situated closer to the site of its production and consumption - your phone, watch, laptop, car and more. This decentralised paradigm of optimising bandwidth, latency, resiliency, and allows data processing to once again be “offshored” - this time from isolated mega data centres to our urban centres.", "The work-in-progress Qianhai Data Centre is set to inhabit a far more human context in the heart of Shenzhen's Qianhai free development zone. While its presence is desired to act as a “digital lighthouse” for this swelling international tech-hub, the familiar scale of the building’s shell is set to be coated with green terraces and a comforting digital display of traditional Chinese iconography, while in fact hoarding an untold bounty of server racks.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='2'></span> Today, not every representation of our coded selves exists in isolated comfort. Yet in certain geographies, such relocations can even evolve into paradoxes."],

The last decade has seen us slowly acknowledge data centres that exist in the wilderness, the periphery, the suburbs, our city centres. We now find ourselves with absurd and anonymous structures next to our homes. We notice familiar typologies that emit an eerie machinal humming sound 24 hours a day. ", "With more and more urban space devoted to digital infrastructure, the twenty-first century “other”, it is only natural that we start to ask: what are the implications of our homes being unconsciously transformed into an unfamiliar synthesis of human/post-human urbanity? How shall we assess these architectural masquerades, a generation of infrastructure that deceives the cities they serve, disguising the mutation of landscapes from humans to data?", "Often monumental in scale while hidden in plain sight, infrastructures entail a specific set of spatial arrangements. Having progressed from individual buildings to engineering networks in their entirety, contemporary infrastructural briefs demand their architects to possess acute political awareness while being cognizant of the influential power of space upon people’s lives and values. Considerations of urban design and technological progress can no longer be detached from the underlying intersectoral entanglement of space.", "On another level, there are ecological concerns at play. Looking slightly beyond Hong Kong to perhaps its main competitor in Asia, Singapore hosts a comparable number of data centres. Nevertheless, “seamless connectivity” means to power up and cool down these buildings 24/7, bringing drastic environmental impacts, particularly in regions of tropical weather. Innovations have been charted by Singaporean stakeholders with the intention of reducing data’s carbon footprint - these include shooting a facility into the heart of the South China Sea, and enhancing the use of renewable resources; even if this means borrowing solar energy from Australia through a 4,500km transmission network.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='1'></span> Within a hype of data, environmental responsibilities have also been pulled into a futuristic realm, while the notion of sovereignty becomes a muddy ground. Camouflaged industrial buildings, floating data centres… infrastructural architecture is defying both physical boundaries and sovereign limits.", "The towering energy consumption of data centres, about 200 kWh in 2019 globally, is the equivalent of the world’s twenty-five most energy hungry nations.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='2'></span> There is a reason why some of these buildings reside in desolate landscapes with cool climates or perhaps even deep in the sea. In contrast, our urban environments, which have been designed for human habitation, are simply not suited to the needs of these buildings. Back in Hong Kong, an optimised edge computing experience is currently facilitated by inefficient modifications to already inefficient buildings. Vast networks of fans, cooling pipes, elevated floors and blocked windows are alterations which allow our power-hungry infrastructures to function, but they are far from environmentally responsible.", "Resource distribution is a historic rebus, and for centuries the inequity of land rights and planning have perpetuated inequality across race, gender, class. Now it seems to be also between humans and more-than-human beings; an issue that extends far beyond the density of Asia’s economic powerhouses. In 2019, Amsterdam and Haarlemmermeer municipality announced that no new data centres would be approved in their metropolitan area. The sector's demands for power and space were described as 'out of control', with an annual growth rate of 10-15%. During a year of pause, these administrations drafted new legislations covering land designation, energy ceilings and annual construction limits. Yet, they now face increasing pressure to lift the moratorium and release a suppressed economic potential.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='3'></span> The case remains unresolved, but there is a clear struggle between digital desires, financial interests and sustainable concerns at play."],

The renowned trifold public health theories from epidemiologist Abdel Omran could be worth revisiting here, for soon after the Age of Pestilence and Famine, and the Age of Receding Pandemics, we may also ascend from the Age of Degenerative and Man-Made Diseases into a looming ‘Digital Eternity’.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='1'></span>", "Speculating the future of our data centres, artificial intelligence has the potential to let these buildings not only operate, but maintain and expand themselves. Following internet connectivity, they are able to obtain data from almost the entire globe, and therefore reference, compare and embark on deep-learning cycles. As data centres continue to grow in size and number, they may start to culminate as digital “cities”. The historical moment will come when we arrive at the era of a post-human spatial condition. Taking a turn from the linear development of history and our relationship to buildings, it is not impossible that architecture can finally be set free from the limitations of human inhabitation.", "A closer inspection of our civilisation in 2020 may not be so far-flung from the aforementioned fantasy. We have already started rendering fragments of daily activity digitally. Transactions, interaction and diplomacy now seamlessly occur without direct human touch. Besides, many are cognisant of alternative personas groomed within our atlas of social media. With innumerable users pouncing at the possibility to conjure and contort distinctive identities detached from their less-satisfying biological reality, the social distancing mandates of COVID-19 further precipitating this spectacle-driven trend. Nevertheless, the intricacies of maintaining a panoply of profiles demand us to constantly negotiate with unsettling internal and external configurations. Multiplicity is becoming a reality, imposing both physical and intangible consequences upon our future lifestyles and living habitats.", "The zeitgeist of our time is both schizophrenic and dynamic, imbued with uncertainty and possibility. After all, cyberpunk is just a literacy genre, an art style that emerged in the ardent 1960s. Half a century later, bodies are pseudo-engineered by digital gadgets, identities are semi-orchestrated by virtual networks, and urbanism is quasi-engulfed by post-human architecture. In these fast-forwarded vignettes, a potential chance of resurrection lies in human creativity, our ability to activate the fluidity of survival within an accelerationist digitality."],

			"title" : "Plato’s Post-human Spatial Programme",
			"text" : ["‘If Victor Hugo is going to deliver a Ted talk today,’ spatial theorist Keller Easterling suggested in her book ‘The Action is the Form’, ‘he will present the architectural model with “a thousand heads and a thousand arms” on the stage to support his theory of space in contemporary politics. Hugo, who is far from an exception among the Ted talks’ speakers, will attempt to convince you with his body mic and a pair of loafers that today, “space is the secret weapon of the most powerful people on earth.”’<span class='footnote' data-footnote='1'></span>", 
			"Easterling is no stranger to the grand data centre ploy, the societal modality of the 21st century that transcends economies of physicality into a realm of virtual and artificial intelligence. In the age of information, she claimed that the discourse of architecture has shifted its focus from singular buildings to infrastructural technologies. Networks upon which our contemporary lifestyles depend, cell phone microwaves, global sea freight, the internet, all of which manifest upon a groundwork of composite infrastructural ecologies.", 
			"The evolving forms of data centres affirms that infrastructural architecture is undergoing rapid transformations. The capitalist premise of economic optimisation has informed a swarm of new architectural prototypes, orchestrating residential, recreational, cultural, corporate and governmental programmes through compositional strategies of complementation, aggregation, multiplication and reduction; new spatial products have expanded our urban landscape like never before. To Easterling, this is the ‘disposition’ of eclectic urban spectacles which have unleashed a performativity of architecture.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='3'></span>", 
			"The convolution of physical and digital social patterns coupled with an explosion of new ideologies echoes contemporary spirits of multiplicity. However, such notions remain uncoupled to those of authenticity, in fact fundamentally paradoxical, their mariage blanc steering us to a ‘post-truth’ age. The intricacies of media and imagery surplus incessantly contest our definition of ‘trust’, with these ever-evolving environments rendering the increasing theatricality of contemporary life. So the question now becomes, what then defines a compelling performance?", 
			"The arts barely impress Plato, and drama even less so, largely due to their artificiality against natural being. The artist and professor of Theatre, Dance & Media at Harvard University, David Levine, elaborated on the dilemma of drama in a Frieze interview, ‘for performance to have any political value, I have to feel like this might be actually happening’.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='4'></span> So performativity needs to move beyond entertainment value, and to Levine this occurs through the act of improvisation, when actors stay in character when slipping away from predetermined narrations. To practise improvisation through the dismantling of any choreographies, numerous performance artists choose rather to infiltrate daily routine. In the same vein, what artistic medium is more prominent than architecture in its potential intervention in our everyday lives?", 
			"<div id='intermission'>Intermission</div>", 
			"If we juxtapose Easterling’s and Levine’s theories side-by-side, does it imply that Architecture is the most powerful form of performance, a medium truly embedded in reality? And if that’s the case, within this slippery fabric of  which is closest to the truth, how should humans act/react?", 
			"In the 5th century BC, Plato claimed that the idea is the truth, while the material particular is a first level of imitation and the art is the semblance of that imitation, which is a copy of the copy (two stages of removal from the truth).<span class='footnote' data-footnote='5'></span>", 
			"In 2020 and beyond, we witness the contemporary world evolving into an algorithm-mediated lifestyle, when digital presence can come before physicality, when all sorts of relationship, professional, emotional, classist, etc, are to different extents determined by one’s appearance in the digital realm. Actualising the virtual, virtualising the actual... today we see the differentiation of Plato’s notions of  ‘truth’, ‘form’ and ‘copy’ becoming unprecedentedly slippery.", 
			"Then, what if Plato has an Instagram account? He may share his new theory in an Instagram story: THE IMAGE USURPS THE TRUTH. In fact, to him the immateriality of an image does carry a sweet sense of nostalgia, reminding him of the same lightness of ‘a concept’ he preciously cherished two-thousand years ago. He may carefully place a #nofilter hashtag (of course Plato despises filters). Back to his profile, the 3x3 grid is the infrastructure, whose fluid performativity is determined by the different sizes of liquid-crystal screens available on the global market today. And his posts? Perhaps some spectacular architectural shots and wait, a rather unassumingly shot of urban weeds…"],

Can we draw a parallel between the relationship of weeds surviving through manhole covers, and the existence of humans amongst data centres? What lessons are there to be learned from weeds, their adaptability, persistence, and resilience, that we can apply to an anticipated post-human future?", "'Weeds' is an umbrella term that does not specify species or genus. Remember their non-complying attitude in relation to geographical, man-made, and linear boundaries, these greenery are the anonymous, everyday greenery that grows independently. Against dominant and anthropocentric urban design, weeds exemplify a “geographic discontinuity’ that Michel Foucault once mentioned to Gilles Deleuze in a conversation regarding 'intellectuals and power'. They suggested that instead of becoming an outweighing force against the common enemy of power, a diffused form of struggle (like the unsung survival of weeds) might be a more effective resistance.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='1'></span> Subverting an anthropocentric perspective, lessons from the phenomenological observation of weeds that postulate our own post-human manifestation are plentiful.", "Transiting from the aforementioned post-human typologies to a discussion of the natural analogue seems to be schizophrenic, but not at all. Plants are the queer avant-gardes. Their sexual organs bear a growth cycle. They are solitarily intimate while requiring an entire ecology to service their life form, embodying a more universal vision for life ahead. Afterall, Donna Haraway’s cyborg manifesto has never felt more realistic than it does today.<span class='footnote' data-footnote='2'></span> Our urbanism is becoming an assemblage of the coldness of programmed machines, the queerness of plants, and fragmented humanism. Culminating a bit of everything, a transmutation of the world is happening.", "Urban weeds embody the search of a playful identity that operates against given demarcation. They are modest yet fluidly formless with an ability to move effortlessly across social and physical boundaries. Especially ballast flora reminds us how weeds possess diverse histories, diaspora, and native languages without being dogmatically defined or categorised. Weeds are but an enthralling and intricate performance, a vibrant transformation of spatial arrangement, the doppelgangers of human survival in the posthuman city.", "As the tactic of our age, performance has the ability to move static entities into a regime of signs, manifesting ephemerality, multiplicity and subjectivity that mirror and echo those of our impalpable digitalised context. The art of performance is the pertinent enactment of physical existence in a digitalised world, when everything is constantly flickering, shifting and developing. Most importantly, the resilience of weeds hints that the performativity of humans may one day redeem our agency when facing threats of identity deprivation and digital colonisation."],

		"about" : ['“No Humans in the City, but Weeds” is an artistic research project undertaken between 2019-2021 by architect Joel Austin and artist Kwan Q Li. Taking Hong Kong as a case in point, the duo observes how data is materialised within urban density, and ponders a future convolution of human and post-human urban environments.', 'The project manifests as a series of essays, illustrations and photographs, accompanied by a short film which is on exhibit in the Hong Kong Pavilion at the 2021 Venice Biennale of Architecture. The research has been presented in EPFL’s 2020-21 LATSIS Symposium Open-forum Deep City: Climate Crisis, Democracy and the Digital, while a related speculative essay is set to be published by the Journal AI & Society: Knowledge, Culture and Communication.]'],
